    Storytelling is a wonderful way to share our life’s unique journey. <br><br>
    "Experiences" is a place to easily capture a memory and create a story using images, dates, location and people whom were present. <br><br>
    It can be used as a tool to capture a treasured document, family secret recipe, significant time or place in life or an important object which you can build a story around for posterity. <br><br>
    By sharing experiences, we have the opportunity to connect, understand and feel closer to each other’s journey.
